This project is a simple verilog project to implement a single cycle CPU. The CPU is based on the MIPS instruction set on 32-bit architecture under Harvard structure. The CPU is designed to be able to run on FPGA board.

## Instruction Set

| Type | Instruction | <center>Description</center> |
| :--: | :---------: | :---------- |
| R    | `add`       | Add |
| R    | `addu`      | Add Unsigned |
| R    | `sub`       | Subtract |
| R    | `subu`      | Subtract Unsigned |
| R    | `and`       | Bitwise AND |
| R    | `or`        | Bitwise OR |
| R    | `xor`       | Bitwise XOR |
| R    | `sll`       | Shift Left Logical |
| R    | `srl`       | Shift Right Logical |
| R    | `sra`       | Shift Right Arithmetic |
| I    | `addi`      | Add Immediate |
| I    | `addiu`     | Add Immediate Unsigned |
| I    | `andi`      | Bitwise AND Immediate |
| I    | `ori`       | Bitwise OR Immediate |
| I    | `lw`        | Load Word |
| I    | `sw`        | Store Word |
| I    | `beq`       | Branch on Equal |
| I    | `bne`       | Branch on Not Equal |
| J    | `j`         | Jump |
| ...  | ...         | ... |

## Usage

Edit the instruction file `inst.asm` in directory of `test/`, and translate it into binary file `inst.bin`. **Note** that the first line of instruction will not be run because that PC is initialized with 0x00000000, and the positive edge of clock which is given at the very beginnig will trigger PC add 4 and run it.

The command `./make hexinst` will generate the hexadecimal instruction file `inst.hex` from `inst.bin` at the same directory.

As the code snippet in `io/InstMem.v` shows, the instruction memory is initialized with the hexadecimal instruction file `inst.hex`.

```verilog
initial begin
    $readmemh("test/inst.hex", MEM_DATA);
end
```

Similarly, the data memory is initialized with the hexadecimal data file `data.hex`, as the code snippet in `io/DataMem.v` will load the data file `data.hex` into the data memory.

```verilog
initial begin
    $readmemh("test/data.hex", MEM_DATA);
end
```

The example instruction file offered in `test` directory solves the problem of whether a year is a leap year. The year number is loaded from the address of `0x00000000` in data memory, and the result (`0` for no, `1` for yes) will be saved at the address of `0x00000008` in data memory.

## Development Tool

This project offers a make tool. Some of the commands are listed below.

- `./make`

  Equal to `./make hexinst && ./make test`

- `./make test`

  Compile and run the testbench (default: `top_sim_testbench.v`)

- `./make <file>` or `./make <file>.v`

  Compile and run the specified verilog file

- `./make clean`

  Remove all the generated files

- `./make hexinst`

  Generate the hexadecimal instruction file from file `inst.bin`

## Simulation

Run `./make test` to simulate the CPU. If the wave cannot meet the needs, modify the following fields at the top of the file `top_sim_testbench.v`.

```verilog
`define N_CLOCKS  10'd500
`define N_OPERATE $stop
```

For example, you can modify `N_CLOCKS` to `10'd100` to simulate the CPU per 100 clocks, then enter `cont` in the terminal prompt to continue next 100 clocks of simulation, or you can modify `N_OPERATE` to `$finish` to finish and exit the simulation after N_CLOCKS clocks.

## Hardware Testing

Top module `TOP_TouchDisplay` (at `top_touch_display.v`), which depends on `constraints.xdc` as the constraint file and `lcd_module.dcp` as its display IP core, is designed and test on **LOONGSON FPGA Board (FPGA-A7-PRJ-UDB) (XC7A200T-FBG676-2)**.

For hardware testing, instance `cpu_rf` in module `Regfile` has exposed `test_addr` and `test_data`, in order that we can see the register file's content on the touch screen. To remove these two ports, just remove all the lines or blocks in this project with comment `? TEST INTERFACE`.

File `top_touch_display.v` allows you to input value into data memory, and meanwhile to read the data memory's content. At the top of the file, edit the following fields to change the address of input and output.

```verilog
`define INPUT1_ADDR  32'b0000
`define INPUT2_ADDR  32'b0100
`define OUTPUT1_ADDR 32'b1000
`define OUTPUT2_ADDR 32'b1100
```

The first input value will be saved at the address of `INPUT1_ADDR`, and the second input value will be saved at the address of `INPUT2_ADDR`. When you touch OK on the touch screen, the value will be automatically saved into the corresponding address of data memory. The content of the address of `OUTPUT1_ADDR` and `OUTPUT2_ADDR` will be displayed on the touch screen.

The top module for this FPGA board also implements button control.

| Button    | Variable    | <center>Description</center> |
| :-------: | :---------: | :---------- |
|  SW18     | `input_sel` | `0` to input for `INPUT1_ADDR`, `1` to input for `INPUT2_ADDR` |
|  SW20     | `cont_clk`  | `0` to use button single trigger, `1` to use continuous trigger |
|  SW_STEP0 | `btn_clkn`  | Press to trigger CPU clock (disabled when `cont_clk` is `1`) (Button Debounced) |
|  SW_STEP1 | `cpu_rstn`  | Press to reset the CPU (PC and Register File) (Button Debounced) |
|  FPGA_RST | /           | Reset the touch screen (clear input, but not mean to clear Data Memory) |

As well as LED display.

| LED       | Variable       | <center>Description</center> |
| :-------: | :------------: | :---------- |
| LED1      | `led_cout_rst` | The reset signal (high level active) |
| LED2      | `led_cout_clk` | The clock signal of CPU (high level active) |

The basic clock frequency is 100 MHz. The CPU clock is 1 MHz. Debounce time is 10 ms.
